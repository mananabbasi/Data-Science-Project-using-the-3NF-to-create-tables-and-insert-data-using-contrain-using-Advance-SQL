# Data-Science-Project-2-using-Advance-SQL

These projects involve the design and implementation of two normalized database systems in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) based on specific requirements. Each database is normalized to the Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data integrity, reduce redundancy, and improve efficiency. The design process includes identifying entities, defining relationships, and establishing primary and foreign keys to maintain referential integrity. Partial and transitive dependencies are eliminated during normalization to achieve a robust and scalable database structure.

The implementation is carried out using T-SQL statements, including creating tables with appropriate data types (e.g., INT for IDs, NVARCHAR for text, and DATE for date values), defining constraints, and establishing relationships between tables. To enhance functionality and enforce business rules, additional database objects such as views, stored procedures, and triggers are created. For example:

Views are used to simplify complex queries and combine related data from multiple tables.

Stored procedures automate repetitive tasks, such as inserting or updating records.

Triggers enforce data integrity rules, such as preventing duplicate entries or validating data before insertion.

Each project is documented with T-SQL scripts, screenshots of the implementation process in SSMS, and a detailed report explaining the design decisions, normalization process, and justification for the chosen data types and constraints. While the overall methodology is consistent across both projects, the specific design and implementation details are tailored to the unique requirements of each database system. This ensures that each project is optimized for its intended use case and adheres to best practices in database design and development.
